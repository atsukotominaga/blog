It's been four months since I posted here last time! Meanwhile, Tofu became very big and very fluffy. She is 8 months old now so becoming an adult cat. Her face looks more mature.

She started wearing a thick winter coat... but perhaps became a bit chubby. We are not sure if we are giving too much food. She seems alright but it might be a good time to switch to adult cat food.

Because it's cold and rainy outside in the Netherlands at this time of year, she prefers to stay inside. Sometimes, she goes outside to go to the toilet but comes back home quickly. She used to play a lot at home but nowadays she sleeps mostly during the day.

She follows us either in the living room or the work/study room and sleeps nearby.

Yet sometimes she wants to play with us. She suddenly disturbs us and asks for our attention. She is a little annoying at times, but very cute. She is still a child.
