We adopted Tofu from our neighbour living next to us. We prepared her toilet and food but didn't buy anything for her bed. She explored our living room and found her favourite place to sleep - on IKEA's blåhajs (shark plushies).

Blåhajs were just the right size for her! Also, the surface of the blåhajs is so soft and comfy.

Double blåhajs give her double happiness.

She was frequently sleeping there. The bread plushie that we got from our friend was also her favourite. She started licking it too much so we removed it from the living room, unfortunately.

She is growing so fast and has become a bit big for these blåhajs. She sleeps more often on chairs or a couch but these blåhajs remain a good reminder of her kittenhood.
